# 1337_Projects
This repository showcases my work as a student at 1337, featuring projects like Libft, Minitalk, Fract-ol, Push-swap, Philosophers, Born2beroot, Ft_printf, and Get_next_line. Each project demonstrates my skills in C programming, algorithms, and system-level development.
I am an Embedded Systems Engineer at ENSA and a student at 1337. This repository showcases a series of projects I've developed in the C programming language, demonstrating my proficiency in embedded systems and foundational programming skills. The projects included in this repository are:

Libft: A personal implementation of standard C library functions, aimed at reinforcing my understanding of memory management and function implementation.
Minitalk: A simple messaging system that demonstrates inter-process communication using Unix signals, showcasing my ability to work with low-level system programming.
Fract-ol: An exploration of fractals that combines mathematical concepts with graphical output, enhancing my skills in algorithms and visualization.
Push-swap: An algorithm that sorts a stack of numbers with minimal moves, emphasizing my ability to develop efficient sorting algorithms and data structures.
Philosophers: A synchronization project inspired by dining philosophers, illustrating my understanding of multi-threading and resource management in concurrent systems.
Born2beroot: A project focused on creating a fully functional Linux server environment, highlighting my skills in system configuration and network management.
Ft_printf: A custom implementation of the printf function, allowing me to delve into format specifiers and variadic functions in C.
Get_next_line: A function that reads a line from a file descriptor, showcasing my ability to handle input/output operations and dynamic memory allocation.
These projects not only showcase my technical skills but also reflect my commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving in embedded systems development
